# Trading Simualator tool

This tool provides a simple way to test different trading strategies on historical data sets. The original intention for the code is to be hooked directly to the Bloomberg API

#### Caveat: This tool is written for Python for 3.4 and PyQT4. Please check for the PyQT5 branch for a more modern (and slighlty broken) version
