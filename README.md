# Trading Simualator tool

This tool provides a simple way to test different trading strategies on historical data sets. The original intention for the code is to be hooked directly to the Bloomberg API, but it can be run using two excel files called *curr_time_series.xlsx* and *index_time_series.xlsx*.

#### Caveat: This tool is written for Python for 3.4 and PyQT4. Please check for the PyQT5 branch for a more modern (and sligtly broken) version
